# elden-x

This repo contains miscellaneous C++ utilities I use to write runtime DLL extensions for ELDEN RING. Used in mods such as:

- [Transmogrify Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3596) by me
- [Glorious Merchant](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5192) by me
- [Armor Dyes](https://github.com/ThomasJClark/elden-ring-dyes) by me
- [Quest Log](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/3585) by TheEldenRingQuestGiver

Feel free to study or import anything here if you're making a similar mod, but note that this isn't intended to be a stable standalone library. I just wanted to common structs in a repo instead of copy pasting it between each project. There may be breaking changes, and not everything is well documented.
